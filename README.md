# Axiscom-ui-react

This repository holds a component library in react based on axiscom-ui. It uses components from the original library to construct new react components.

### Structure

The library leverages storybook to provide a UI to easily view and test components. The library itself is then packaged and published to npm with parcel.

## Setup

First, you'll have to install dependencies (You need yarn in order to do this):

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development

For development and publishing, run:

```bash
yarn watch
```

To view and develop stories, you can run storybook (dev):

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Deployment

To package your components, run:

```bash
yarn build
```

More information to come on how to publish to axis registry.
